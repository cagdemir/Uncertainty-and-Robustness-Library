This repo will be build up to comprise uncertainty quantification, robustness assessment, and calibration metrics, methods and technigues in Deep Learning. There are several libraries and repos out there, however they are either (i) unfinished/not complete/narrow-scoped or (ii) fail to serve the purpose of their raison d’être. Once this library reaches a certain size (as well as a good quality), this text will self-destruct.
